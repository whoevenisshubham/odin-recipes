      <p>Picanha is a prized cut of beef in Brazil, known for its rich flavor and tender texture. It's typically grilled over open flame or cooked on skewers over charcoal, making it a staple in Brazilian churrasco (barbecue). The fat cap on top helps retain moisture and adds a distinct depth of flavor during cooking.</p>
