  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Picanha is a prized cut of beef in Brazil, known for its rich flavor and tender texture. It's typically grilled over open flame or cooked on skewers over charcoal, making it a staple in Brazilian churrasco (barbecue).</p>
  <p>The fat cap on top helps retain moisture and adds a distinct depth of flavor during cooking.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 kg picanha beef cut (top sirloin cap)</li>
    <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>Garlic (optional, for marinade)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Score the fat cap lightly without cutting into the meat.</li>
    <li>Season the meat generously with coarse salt (and pepper or garlic if using).</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill to high heat.</li>
    <li>Grill the picanha fat-side down first until crisp.</li>
    <li>Flip and grill until desired doneness (medium rare is traditional).</li>
    <li>Rest the meat for 5â€“10 minutes before slicing against the grain and serving.</li>
  </ol>
